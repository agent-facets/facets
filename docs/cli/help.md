description: Show help for the CLI or a specific command

## Usage

```sh
facet --help
facet <command> --help
```

Prints usage information. With no command, shows the global help listing all available commands. With a command name, shows that command's usage, description, and flags.

## Global help

```sh
facet --help
```

Lists every registered command with a short description. Stub commands (not yet implemented) are hidden from this output but still resolve for typo suggestions.

## Per-command help

```sh
facet add --help
facet build --help
facet adapter install --help
```

Shows the command's usage line, description, available flags with defaults, and a `--help` flag reference. Aliases (e.g., `self-upgrade` for `self-update`) are listed alongside the canonical name.

## Version

```sh
facet --version
```

Prints the installed CLI version and exits.
