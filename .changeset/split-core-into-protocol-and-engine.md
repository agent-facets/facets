Split `@agent-facets/core` into two layers:

- **`@agent-facets/protocol`** (NEW, public, Node-native) — the TypeScript reference implementation of the facet artifact specification: schemas, bytes-validators, integrity verification, deterministic archive format, hash algorithm, version-spec grammar, front-matter encoding, and build validators. Runs on Node 22+ with no Bun dependency, so registry servers (Lambda) and other third-party tooling can consume it.
- **`@agent-facets/engine`** (RENAMED from `@agent-facets/core`, made private) — the Bun-native CLI machinery: install pipeline, registry client, adapter machinery, scaffold, edit, self-update, source resolvers, manifest mutations, cache, build pipeline orchestrator, gzip compression. Internal to the monorepo; never published.

`@agent-facets/core` is no longer published; the legacy package is frozen at v0.9.1.

CLI behavior is unchanged. The split is a structural refactor: every `@agent-facets/core` import in the CLI was redirected to either `@agent-facets/protocol` (data primitives) or `@agent-facets/engine` (orchestrators).
