Record lockfile source provenance as a tagged, per-kind shape so an entry can never disagree with itself.

The lockfile's `source` field was a single overloaded string — a registry version specifier, a git URL, or a local path depending on the facet. For registry facets this let an unresolved specifier (`latest`, `1.*`) leak into the lockfile next to a resolved `version`, an entry that contradicted itself. `source` is now a discriminated union keyed on `kind`:

- **`registry`** — records the registry origin (base URL) and never a version. The resolved version lives in the entry's `version` field, so there is no slot for `latest` or a wildcard to leak into.
- **`git`** — records the repository URL and a **required** resolved commit SHA. A git clone that cannot be pinned to a commit now fails the install rather than writing a non-reproducible entry. The requested ref is no longer recorded in the lockfile — it belongs to `facets.json`.
- **`local`** — records the resolved path.

This is a breaking change to the published lockfile schema. There is no migration and no `lockfileVersion` bump: an older flat-`source` lockfile is simply invalid under the new shape and fails install in **every** mode (frozen and non-frozen alike), rather than being silently regenerated. Delete `facets.lock` and re-run install to regenerate it in the new shape. Extra unrecognized keys on a source remain tolerated for forward-compatibility.
